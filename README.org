* RICE - Rice Is a Configuration collEction

This is a collection of my daily tool configurations.

** Get Started

Simply use =install.sh= script to install supported configs.

#+begin_src shell
# List supported configs
$ ./install.sh

# Install selected ones
$ ./install.sh bash pwsh git tmux
#+end_src

To add a new config installation, define a function in =install.sh= with name =NAME_conf=. Check the [[./install.sh][script]] for details.

** Philosophy
*** Why not use GNU Stow to manage dotfiles?

=Stow= is ideally good for a clean installation like Arch Linux where there are minimal files created in user's home directory. However, most of popular distros like to create a bunch of files by default, then =Stow= will have a hard time to link the files.

Unfortunately I have to work on those distros most of the time.

Also sometimes configuration is modified for some specific purposes but those changes are not intended to be tracked.

A better solution in this case is to use the import-ish feature if this kind of syntax is supported.
