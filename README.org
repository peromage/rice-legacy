* About
This is a collection of my daily tool configurations.

* Get started
Configurations are managed by GNU =Stow=.

#+begin_src shell
# Use the setup script to make life easier
./setup.sh --stow

# Or one may want to type manually (equivalent to the script)
stow -d ./stow -t $HOME .
# To hoose specific packages
stow -d ./config -t $HOME pkg1 pkg2
#+end_src

To sync the repository, use =setup.sh= since it automatically stashes unmerged changes.
#+begin_src shell
./setup.sh --sync
#+end_src
