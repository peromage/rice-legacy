* About
This is a configuration collection of my daily drivers.

[[./config][config]] directory contains all the configurations.  They are organized in a way that how they are located in the actual home directory, so each of them can be managed by =stow= individually.

[[./bin][bin]] directory contains scripts and small executables which I use most of the times.

Directories that starts with =PRESET-= are the combinations I use often for different scenarios.  They can be managed by =stow= directly.

* Get started
All the configurations are managed by GNU =stow=.

Use the script [[./stow.sh][stow.sh]] to quickly manage presets.

#+begin_src shell
# Stow
./stow -S PRESET-general
./stow --stow PRESET-general

# Unstow
./stow -D PRESET-general
./stow --delete PRESET-general

# Restow
./stow -R PRESET-general
./stow --restow PRESET-general
#+end_src
